This is a small collection of differential operators from applications for use
with the ore_algebra[1] SageMath[2] package. This collection complements the
examples built into ore_algebra with operators that are too large to be
included there, too specialized, redundant with existing examples, etc.

None of the contents is stable: data may be removed, modules renamed, etc. from
version to version. If you use this repository in your own work, consider
pinning to a specific git revision.

To the extent possible under law, the contributors have waived all copyright and
related or neighboring rights to the contents of this repository.

Contributions are welcome. Please follow the general format of existing files
(pure Python modules, 80 char lines or whatever the length of integer
coefficients allows, at least some information on the origin of the problems and
1-2Â relevant usage examples in the module docstring, ideally include
problem-specific utility functions when relevant).

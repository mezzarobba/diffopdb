This is a collection of differential operators from applications for use
with the ore_algebra[1] SageMath[2] package. This collection complements the
examples built into ore_algebra with operators that are too large to be
included there, too specialized, redundant with existing examples, etc.

None of the contents is stable: data may be removed, modules renamed, etc. from
version to version. If you use this repository in your own work, consider
pinning to a specific git revision.

To the extent possible under law, the contributors have waived all copyright and
related or neighboring rights to the contents of this repository.

Contributions are welcome. All data should be accessible through Python modules.
Please include some information on the origin of the problems and 1-2 usage
examples in the module docstring. There is no fixed format or indexing scheme at
this stage, but please try to be consistent with existing modules when possible
(e.g., prefer coefficients in ℤ[t] to coefficients in ℚ[t] or ℚ(t), prefer pure
python modules to sage source files, use git-annex[3] for large files). Modules
may also contain problem-specific utility functions.

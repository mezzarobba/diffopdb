This is a small collection of differential operators from applications for use
with the ore_algebra[1] SageMath[2] package. This collection complements the
examples built into ore_algebra with operators that are too large to be
included there, too specialized, redundant with existing examples, etc.

None of the contents is stable: data may be removed, modules renamed, etc. from
version to version. If you use this repository in your own work, consider
pinning to a specific git revision.

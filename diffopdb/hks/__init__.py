The following text is adapted from the description they provided:

Each subdirectory in data/ corresponds to a single one-parameter family with
the fibre over 0 being the first polynomial and the fibre over 1 being the
other. For example, the directory

data/edge-ivp__x3w+x2w2+xw3+y3z+yz3__x3w+x2w2+xw3+y4+z4/

corresponds to the 1-parameter family

T * (x^3 w + x^2 w^2 + x w^3 + y^3 z+ y z^3) + (1-T) * (x^3 w + x^2 w^2 + xw^3 + y^4 + z^4)

Within this directory you'll find up to 21 different files of the form dop.$n
or dop.$n.xz where $n is a number in {1, ..., 21}. The differential equation in
that file is the Picard-Fuchs differential equation which annihilates the n-th
cohomology class on the pencil of K3's.

    416*t - 52)*D^2 + (80190*t^6 - 103680*t^5 + 90846*t^4 - 41328*t^3 +
    13050*t^2 - 2448*t + 234)*D + 18225*t^5 - 22194*t^4 + 32598*t^3 - 16080*t^2
